    "## Word embeddings\n",
    "\n",
    "When you're dealing with words in text, you end up with tens of thousands of classes to predict, one for each word. Trying to `one-hot encode` these words is massively inefficient, you'll have one element set to 1 and the other 50,000 set to 0. The matrix multiplication going into the first hidden layer will have almost all of the resulting values be zero. This a huge waste of computation. \n",
    "\n",
    "![one-hot encodings](assets/one_hot_encoding.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "To solve this problem and greatly increase the efficiency of our networks, we use what are called embeddings. Embeddings are just a fully connected layer like you've seen before. We call this layer the embedding layer and the weights are embedding weights. \n",
    "\n",
    "> We skip the multiplication into the embedding layer by instead directly grabbing the hidden layer values from the weight matrix. \n",
    "\n",
    "> We can do this because the multiplication of a one-hot encoded vector with a matrix returns the row of the matrix corresponding the index of the \"on\" input unit.\n",
    "\n",
    "![lookup](assets/lookup_matrix.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead of doing the matrix multiplication, we use the weight matrix as a lookup table. We encode the words as integers, for example \"heart\" is encoded as 958, \"mind\" as 18094. Then to get hidden layer values for \"heart\", you just take the 958th row of the embedding matrix. This process is called an **embedding lookup** and the number of hidden units is the **embedding dimension**.\n",

    "<img src='assets/tokenize_lookup.png' width=500>\n",

    "There is nothing magical going on here. \n",
    "* The embedding lookup table is just a weight matrix. \n",
    "* The embedding layer is just a hidden layer. \n",
    "* The lookup process is just a shortcut for the matrix multiplication. \n",
    "* The embedding lookup table is trained just like any weight matrix as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "> Embeddings are not only used for words of course. You can use them for any model where you have a massive number of classes.\n",

So, if you have 10,000 words and 300 hidden units, the matrix will have size $10,000 \\times 300$. Remember that we're using tokenized data for our inputs, usually as integers, where the number of tokens is the number of words in our vocabulary.\n",

    "**Exercise:** Tensorflow provides a convenient function [`tf.nn.embedding_lookup`](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/nn/embedding_lookup) that does this lookup for us. You pass in the embedding matrix and a tensor of integers, then it returns rows in the matrix corresponding to those integers. Below, set the number of embedding features you'll use (200 is a good start), create the embedding matrix variable, and use `tf.nn.embedding_lookup` to get the embedding tensors. For the embedding matrix, I suggest you initialize it with a uniform random numbers between -1 and 1 using [tf.random_uniform](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/random_uniform)."

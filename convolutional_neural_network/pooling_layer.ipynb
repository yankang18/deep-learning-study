    "The pooling layers are generally used to decrease the size of the output of previous layer and prevent overfitting. Reducing overfitting is a consequence of the reducing the output size, which in turn, reduces the number of parameters in future layers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Recently, pooling layers have fallen out of favor. Some reasons are:\n",
    "* Recent datasets are so big and complex we're more concerned about underfitting.\n",
    "* Dropout is a much better regularizer.\n",
    "* Pooling results in a loss of information. Think about the max pooling operation as an example. We only keep the largest of n numbers, thereby disregarding n-1 numbers completely.\n",

    "The image above is an example of max pooling with a 2x2 filter and stride of 2. The four 2x2 colors represent each time the filter was applied to find the maximum value.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, [[1, 0], [4, 6]] becomes 6, because 6 is the maximum value in this set. Similarly, [[2, 3], [6, 8]] becomes 8.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Conceptually, the benefit of the max pooling operation is to reduce the size of the input, and allow the neural network to focus on only the most important elements. Max pooling does this by only retaining the maximum value for each filtered area, and removing the remaining values.\n",

    "* 2x2 filters with a stride of 2x2 are common in practice.\n",
